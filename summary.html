    <h1>Summary of First two chapters of Born a crime</h1>
    <p><i>
        Trevor, the author talks about the period way before apartheid when the black people in South Africa were divided into tribes.  Trevor’s mother is a devout Christian and her unwavering faith in God does not  let anything deter her from attending the Sunday services. Trevor likes church but dislikes the hassle that comes with commuting to them. One Sunday on their way to church, his mother and a bus driver get into an argument, which ends up  with Patricia throwing Trevor out of the moving bus and jumping from it. 
        
        After the British rule ended, the Afrikaners took over the South African government.  They came up with a system of racial oppression that was known as apartheid. Patricia ran away from home and went to live in Johannesburg. She met a Swiss expat with whom she sired a child despite it being illegal to have mixed-race children. In this chapter, Trevor said, “While most children are proof of their parents’ love, I was proof of their criminality.” <br> When he was around 17 years old, Trevor was shocked to find out that  they had the option to leave the country during apartheid but his mother did not want to.
        
        I can relate the two chapters to how some of the people I know still have internalized colonialism and treat white people better than their fellow Africans. It is sad to see that most of them still have that mentality despite the fact that colonialism is over.
